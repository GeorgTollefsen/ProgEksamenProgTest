Home Workout Program


# Description:
This is a system for managing exercises for our home workout program. 
This was our exam project in course ITP 2200 Introduction to software testing.


Requirements:

**1. Exercises are grouped into Programs**

- Each program keeps an account of the overall intensity (the highest intensity
among the included exercises).

- Each program keeps account of whether or not it is balanced. A balanced
program has at least one exercise of each type.

-  Each program has the exercises sorted in order of increasing intensity. 

-  Each program has an overall duration. The duration of an exercise is the twice
the sum of the durations of all the exercises it includes (to account for rest).


**2. Each person has a level of intensity they find appropriate, and a type of exercise they
prefer. For each person, suggest an exercise program that is of the type they prefer,
and has a level of intensity +/- 10% of the personâ€™s preferred intensity level.**

**3. The ExerciseManager should have**

-  Methods for deciding if a Program is appropriate for a given Person

-  Methods for building new Programs

- method for recommending, from a given collection of Programs, which is
most appropriate for a given Person. 

# Installation:
To run the program we recommend you to use IntelliJ. Once you have loaded the program you can select main from the top and press play. You will then get the output in the terminal window below. You also need to have JDK installed. 
Feel free to clone the source code.

# How to use:
To run the home workout program you need to pick an option from our awesome meny. 
The home workout program contains of programs with exercises of types like strength, endurance, balance and flexibility.

You can look at all the programs to see which kind of exercises they contain, the duration and if it's a balanced program or not. If you choose the option "show information about a person", you will get a list of persons, and on each person you will get information about preferred intensity and preferred exercise type.

We also have an exercise manager where you can choose from the menu to check if a program is appropriate for a person, build a new program, or you can get a program recommended for a specific person. On "build a new program" you will get an opportunity to make your own program. You give it a name and choose exercises from the list.
